# Understanding JavaScript Arrays

![Sample Image](/article2.jpeg "Sample Image")


Arrays are one of the fundamental data structures in JavaScript, used to store multiple values in a single variable. In this guide, we'll explore the basics of JavaScript arrays, including how to create, access, and manipulate them.

## Creating Arrays

You can create an array in JavaScript using the array literal syntax, which consists of square brackets []. For example:

```javascript
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];
```

## Accessing Array Elements
You can access individual elements in an array using square bracket notation and the index of the element. Remember, JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0. For example:

```javascript
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: 'Apple'
console.log(numbers[2]); // Output: 3
```

## Array Methods
JavaScript arrays come with a variety of built-in methods for manipulating their contents. Some common methods include:

push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns it.

shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns it.

unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.

slice(): Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array.

splice(): Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements.

## Iterating Over Arrays
You can iterate over the elements of an array using loops such as for loops or array methods like forEach(), map(), filter(), etc. For example:

```javascript
fruits.forEach(fruit => {
  console.log(fruit);
});
```
